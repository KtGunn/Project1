# Project1
This project creates an environment ("world") for simlution in Gazebo. The environment includes an enclosed space ("building") and robots. The building is arbitrary but so designed that small robots can freely travel through it. The environment's size allows a complete view of the space and robots in it from an overhead vantage point. Objects were included in the space to present both path planning and obstacle avoidacne challenges while also providing features for localization. 

The screen shot below show the simulation environment:
